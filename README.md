# 📰 Blog Management System – Next.js App Router with Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and MongoDB

## 🌐 What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** is a web development technique where HTML is dynamically generated on the **server** in response to each request. Unlike client-side rendering—where content is generated in the browser using JavaScript—SSR ensures that the user receives a fully rendered HTML page from the server.

In **Next.js (App Router)**, SSR is enabled by default in **server components**, and you can explicitly control rendering behavior using features like:

- `fetch(..., { cache: 'no-store' })` – to disable caching and fetch fresh data on every request
- `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` – to mark a page as dynamic and server-rendered

### ✅ Advantages of SSR in Next.js:
- 🔍 **SEO Optimization** – Pre-rendered HTML improves discoverability by search engines.
- ⚡ **Faster First Load** – Content appears faster on initial load, enhancing user experience.
- 🔄 **Fresh Data on Each Request** – Ideal for dynamic content such as blogs, dashboards, or news feeds.
- 🔐 **Increased Security** – Data fetching and business logic stay on the server.

This project uses SSR to fetch and render blog content in real-time, making it SEO-friendly and always up to date.

## 📘 Project Overview

This is a **full-stack Blog Management System** built using **Next.js App Router** and **MongoDB**. It allows bloggers to manage their content efficiently with full **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Blog data is stored in MongoDB, and API routes built with the new `app/api` pattern handle data interactions. The frontend uses **server-rendered pages** to ensure fast performance and up-to-date content delivery.
